        During the summer of 2003, events in the northeastern United States involving a strange,
        human-like creature sparked brief local media interest before an apparent blackout was enacted.
        Little or no information was left intact, as most online and written accounts of the creature were mysteriously destroyed.

      <p>
        Primarily focused in rural New York state and once found in Idaho, self proclaimed witnesses told stories of their encounters with a creature of unknown origin. 
        Emotions ranged from extremely traumatic levels of fright and discomfort to an almost childlike sense of playfulness and curiosity. 
        While their published versions are no longer on record, the memories remained powerful. Several of the involved parties began looking for answers that year.
        In early 2006, the collaboration had accumulated nearly two dozen documents dating between the 12th century and present day, spanning 4 continents. 
        In almost all cases, the stories were identical. 
        Iâ€™ve been in contact with a member of this group, and was able to get some excerpts from their upcoming book.

      <h2>A Journal Entry</h2>
      <p>
        "I have experienced the greatest terror. I have experienced the greatest terror. 
        I have experienced the greatest terror. I see his eyes when I close mine. They are hollow. Black. 
        They saw me and pierced me. His wet hand. I will not sleep. His voice (unintelligible text)."
      </p>

      <h2>A Mariner's Log</h2>
      <p>
        "He came to me in my sleep. From the foot of my bed, I felt a sensation. He took everything. 
        We must return to England. We shall not come here again at the request of the Rake."
